ll of a sudden 
new economies and new capabilities, new economies. What would happen if a video conference made 
it possible for us to see each other without having to travel anymore? All of a sudden 
it's actually okay to work further away from home and from work, work and live 
further away. And so you ask yourself kind of these questions. You know what would happen 
if I have a software programmer with me all the time and whatever it is I can dream up, 
the software programmer could write for me. You know what would, what would happen 
if I just had a seed of an idea and and I rough it out and all of sudden a you know 
a prototype of a production was put in front of me? And what how would that change my life and 
how would that change my opportunity? And you know what does it free me to be able to do and 
and so on so forth. And so I think that the next the next decade intelligence, not for everything 
but for for some things, would basically become superhuman. But I can tell 
you exactly what that feels like. I'm surrounded by superhuman people, super intelligence from 
my perspective because they're the best in the world at what they do and they do what they 
do way better than I can do it. and I'm surrounded by thousands of them and yet what it 
it never one day caused me to to think all of a son I'm no longer necessary. It actually empowers 
me and gives me the confidence to go tackle more and more ambitious things. And so suppose, 
suppose now everybody is surrounded by these super AIs that are very good at specific things 
or good at some of the things. What would that make you feel? Well it's going to empower you, 
it's going to make you feel confident and and I'm pretty sure you probably use ChatGPT and 
AI and I feel more empowered today, more confident to learn something today. The knowledge 
of almost any particular field, the barriers to that understanding, it has been reduced and I have 
a personal tutor with me all of the time. And so I think that t
-> summary ->
*   The advent of technologies like video conferencing and AI fundamentally alters the relationship between individuals and specialized expertise, facilitating remote collaboration and access to global talent.
*   Individuals will experience increased confidence and empowerment through the availability of "superhuman" intelligence, particularly within specific domains like software development and knowledge acquisition.
*   The proliferation of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, reduces barriers to learning and personal understanding across various fields, effectively providing personalized, on-demand tutoring.
*   This shift toward surrounding oneself with intelligent tools fundamentally changes the perception of individual necessity, fostering a greater capacity for ambitious endeavors and increased self-assurance.
