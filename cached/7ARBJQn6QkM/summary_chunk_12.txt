 Star Trek, Isaac 
Asimov's books and just dreaming about a future with robots, how do we get from the robots that we have 
now to the future world that you see of robotics? Yeah let me use language models maybe ChatGPT 
as a reference for understanding Omniverse and Cosmos. So first of all when ChatGPT first 
came out it, it was extraordinary and it has the ability to do to basically from 
your prompt, generate text. However, as amazing as it was, it has the tendency to hallucinate if
it goes on too long or if it pontificates about a topic it you know is not informed about, it'll 
still do a good job generating plausible answers. It just wasn't grounded in the truth. And so
people called it hallucination. And so the next generation shortly it was, it had 
the ability to be conditioned by context, so you could upload your PDF and now it's grounded 
by the PDF. The PDF becomes the ground truth. It could be it could actually look up search and 
then the search becomes its ground truth. And between that it could reason about what is how 
to produce the answer that you're asking for. And so the first part is a generative AI and the 
second part is ground truth. Okay and so now let's come into the the physical world. The
world model, we need a foundation model just like we need ChatGPT had a core foundation model 
that was the breakthrough in order for robotics to to be smart about the physical world. It has to 
understand things like gravity, friction, inertia, geometric and spatial awareness. It has to uh 
understand that an object is sitting there even when I looked away when I come back it's still 
sitting there, object permanence. It has to understand cause and effect. If I tip it, it'll 
fall over. And so these kind of physical common sense if you will has to be captured or 
encoded into a world foundation model so that the AI has world common sense. Okay and so we 
have to go, somebody has to go create that, and that's what we did with Cosmos. We created a world 

-> summary ->
*   Generative AI, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, demonstrates the capacity to produce plausible text outputs based on prompts, though this capability is susceptible to inaccuracies or “hallucinations” when dealing with unfamiliar or extended topics.
*   Subsequent advancements in AI involve “ground truth” incorporation, enabling systems to be anchored by external data sources such as uploaded PDFs or search results, thereby improving response accuracy and reliability.
*   The development of a “world foundation model” is crucial for robotics, requiring the encoding of physical principles such as gravity, friction, and object permanence to facilitate understanding of the physical environment.
*   This world foundation model must capture basic “common sense” regarding cause and effect, spatial awareness, and object permanence, allowing robots to operate effectively within the physical world.
