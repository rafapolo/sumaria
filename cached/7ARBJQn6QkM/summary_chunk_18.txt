ely recognizable as a 
transformer years from now. And we believe the latter. And the reason for that is because you 
just have to go back in history and ask yourself, in the world of computer algorithms, in 
the world of software, in the world of engineering and innovation, has one idea stayed 
along that long? And the answer is no. And so that's kind of the beauty, that's in fact 
the essential beauty of a computer that it's able to do something today that no one even imagined 
possible 10 years ago. And if you would have, if you would have turned that computer 10 years ago 
into a microwave, then why would the applications keep coming? And so we believe, we believe in the 
richness of innovation and the richness of invention and we want to create an 
architecture that let inventors and innovators and software programmers and AI researchers 
swim in the soup and come up with some amazing ideas. Look at transformers. The fundamental 
characteristic of a transformer is this idea called "attention mechanism" and it basically says 
the transformer is going to understand the meaning and the relevance of every single word with every 
other word. So if you had 10 words, it has to figure out the relationship across 10 of them. But if you 
have a 100,000 words or if your context is now as large as, read a PDF and that read a whole 
bunch of PDFs, and the context window is now like a million tokens, the processing all of it across 
all of it is just impossible. And so the way you solve that problem is there all kinds of new ideas, 
flash attention or hierarchical attention or you know all the, wave attention I just read about 
the other day. The number of different types of attention mechanisms that have been invented 
since the transformer is quite extraordinary. And so I think that that's going to continue 
and we believe it's going to continue and that that computer science hasn't ended and that AI 
research have not all given up and we haven't given up anyhow and that h
-> summary ->
*   The design emphasizes a fundamentally adaptable architecture, mirroring the historical trend of computer algorithms continually evolving beyond initial conceptions.
*   A core principle involves the “attention mechanism,” enabling processors to dynamically assess the relationships between all elements within a given context, scaling to extremely large datasets like extensive text documents.
*   The architecture is conceived to foster a vibrant ecosystem of invention, accommodating a diverse range of computational approaches, including novel attention mechanisms like flash attention and hierarchical attention.
*   The underlying belief is that computer science and AI research are ongoing fields of innovation, anticipating and accommodating continued advancements in computational techniques.
