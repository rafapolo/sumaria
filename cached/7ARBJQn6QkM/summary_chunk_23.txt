hat feeling should be universal.
If there's one thing that I would encourage everybody to do is to go get yourself 
an AI tutor right away. And that AI tutor could of course just teach your things, anything you 
like, help you program, help you write, help you analyze, help you think, help you reason, 
you know all of those things is going to really make you feel empowered and and I think 
that going to be our future. We're going to become, we're going to become super humans, 
not because we have super, we're going to become super humans because we have super AIs. Could you 
tell us a little bit about each of these objects? This is a new GeForce graphics card and yes and 
this is the RTX 50 Series. It is essentially a supercomputer that you put into your PC and we 
use it for gaming, of course people today use it for design and creative arts and it does amazing 
AI. The real breakthrough here and this is this is truly an amazing thing, GeForce 
enabled AI and it enabled Geoff Hinton, Ilya Sutskever, Alex Krizhevsky to be able to train AlexNet. We
discovered AI and we advanced AI then AI came back to GeForce to help computer graphics. And so here's 
the amazing thing: Out of 8 million pixels or so in a 4K display we are computing, we're processing 
only 500,000 of them. The rest of them we use AI to predict. The AI guessed it and yet the image is 
perfect. We inform it by the 500,000 pixels that we computed and we ray traced every single one and it's 
all beautiful. It's perfect. And then we tell the AI, if these are the 500,000 perfect pixels in this 
screen, what are the other 8 million? And it goes it fills in the rest of the screen and it's perfect.
And if you only have to do fewer pixels, are you able to invest more in doing that because you have 
fewer to do so then the quality is better so the extrapolation that the AI does... Exactly. Because 
whatever computing, whatever attention you have, whatever resources you have, you can place it into 
500,000 pixels. 
-> summary ->
*   The widespread adoption of AI tutors is advocated to foster a sense of empowerment and represent a transformative future where individuals leverage artificial intelligence to enhance their capabilities.

*   New GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards incorporate AI technology, functioning as miniature supercomputers primarily utilized for gaming, design, and creative applications, while also facilitating advancements in artificial intelligence.

*   A key innovation involves the use of AI to predict and complete missing pixels within high-resolution displays, reducing computational demands by leveraging AI to extrapolate image details, enabling higher quality outputs.

*   This process involves a strategic allocation of computing resources, prioritizing the detailed rendering of 500,000 pixels while utilizing AI to predict and complete the remaining pixels, thereby optimizing resource utilization and image fidelity.
