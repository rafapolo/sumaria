mprove the share price or whatever it is. But you have to believe in your future. You have to 
invest in yourself. And we believe this so deeply that we invested you know tens 
of billions of dollars before it really happened. And yeah it was, it was 10 long 
years. But it was fun along the way. How would you summarize those core beliefs? What 
is it that you believe about the way computers should work and what they can do for us that keeps 
you not only coming through that decade but also doing what you're doing now, making bets I'm sure 
you're making for the next few decades? The first core belief was our first discussion, was about 
accelerated computing. Parallel computing versus general purpose computing. We would add 
two of those processors together and we would do accelerated computing. And I continue to believe 
that today. The second was the recognition that these deep learning networks, these DNNs, that 
came to the public during 2012, these deep neural networks have the ability to learn patterns and 
relationships from a whole bunch of different types of data. And that it can learn more and 
more nuanced features if it could be larger and larger. And it's easier to make them larger and 
larger, make them deeper and deeper or wider and wider, and so the scalability of the architecture 
is empirically true. The fact that model size and the data size being larger 
and larger, you can learn more knowledge is also true, empirically true. And so if that's 
the case, you could you know, what what are the limits? There not, unless there's a physical limit 
or an architectural limit or mathematical limit and it was never found, and so we believe that you 
could scale it. Then the question, the only other question is: What can you learn from data? What 
can you learn from experience? Data is basically digital versions of human experience. And so what 
can you learn? You obviously can learn object recognition from images. You can learn speech 
from just listening 
-> summary ->
*   A foundational conviction is the necessity of investing in self-development to drive long-term organizational success, exemplified by substantial prior investments despite a decade-long period of uncertainty.

*   The core belief centers on accelerated computing, specifically the strategic combination of parallel processing to achieve enhanced computational capabilities.

*   A critical tenet involves the recognition of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their inherent scalability, predicated on the empirically demonstrated capacity to learn increasingly complex patterns through expanded model size and data volume.

*   Ultimately, the organization’s approach is rooted in the assumption that data—representing digitized human experience—serves as the primary source for knowledge acquisition and learning, irrespective of inherent architectural or mathematical constraints.
