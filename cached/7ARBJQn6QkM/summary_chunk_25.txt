 today, irrespective whether it's for for math or for science or chemistry 
or biology or doesn't matter what field of science I'm going to go into or what profession, I'm 
going to ask myself, how can I use AI to do my job better? If I want to be a lawyer, how can I use 
AI to be a better lawyer? If I want to be a better do doctor, how can I use AI to be a better doctor? 
If I want to be a chemist, how do I use AI to be a better chemist? If I want to be a biologist, I how 
do I use AI to be a better biologist? That question should be persistent across everybody. And just as 
my generation grew up as the first generation that has to ask ourselves, how can we use computers 
to do our jobs better? Yeah the generation before us had no computers, my generation was the first 
generation that had to ask the question, how do I use computers to do my job better? Remember I came 
into the industry before Windows 95 right, 1984 there were no computers in offices. And after that, 
shortly after that, computers started to emerge and so we had to ask ourselves how do we use computers 
to do our jobs better? The next generation doesn't have to ask that question but it has to ask 
obviously next question, how can I use AI to do my job better? That is start and finish I think 
for everybody. It's a really exciting and scary and therefore worthwhile question I think for everyone. 
I think it's going to be incredibly fun. AI is obviously a word that people are just learning 
now but it's just you know, it's made your computer so much more accessible. It is 
easier to prompt ChatGPT to ask it anything you like than to go do the research yourself. And so 
we've lowered a barrier of understanding, we've lowered a barrier of knowledge, we've 
lowered a barrier of intelligence, and and everybody really had to just go try 
it. You know the thing that's really really crazy is if I put a computer in front of somebody and 
they've never used a computer there is no chance they're going to lear
-> summary ->
*   The fundamental shift involves proactively integrating artificial intelligence into professional workflows across all scientific and professional disciplines.
*   Individuals are increasingly confronting the necessity of determining how AI can enhance their job performance, mirroring a previous transition with the introduction of computers.
*   Accessibility of AI tools, exemplified by platforms like ChatGPT, is dramatically reducing the barriers to knowledge acquisition and problem-solving within professions.
*   This represents a generational change where the initial focus is on leveraging AI, while subsequent generations will undoubtedly grapple with the evolving capabilities of intelligent systems.
