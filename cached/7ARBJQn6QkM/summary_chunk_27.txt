he consequential work that we're doing and the 
potential impact it has on so many people that we want to make make this capability 
as pervasively as possible and I do think that when we look back in a few 
years, and I do hope that what the next generation realized is as they, well 
first of all they're going to know us because of all the you know gaming technology we create.
I do think that we'll look back and the whole field of digital biology and life sciences has 
been transformed. Our whole understanding of of material sciences has completely been 
revolutionized. That robots are helping us do dangerous and mundane things all over the 
place. That if we wanted to drive we can drive but otherwise you know take a nap or enjoy 
your car like it's a home theater of yours, you know read from work to home and at that 
point you're hoping that you live far away and so you could be in a car for longer. 
And you look back and you realize that there's this company almost at 
the epicenter of all of that and happens to be the company that
you grew up playing games with. I hope for that to be
what the next generation learn. Thank you so much for your time.
I enjoyed it, thank you! I'm glad!
