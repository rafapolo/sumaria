Now this is a perfect example of why AI is going to make us all superhuman, because 
all of the other things that it can do, it'll do for us, allows us to take our time and energy and 
focus it on the really really valuable things that we do. And so we'll take our own resource which is 
you know energy intensive, attention intensive, and we'll dedicated to the few 100,000 pixels and 
use AI to superres, upres it you know to everything else. And so this this graphics card 
is now powered mostly by AI and the computer graphics technology inside is incredible as 
well. And then this next one, as I mentioned earlier, in 2016 I built the first one for AI 
researchers and we delivered the first one to Open AI and Elon was there to receive it and this 
version I built a mini mini version and the reason for that is because AI has now gone from AI 
researchers to every engineer, every student, every AI scientist. And AI is going to be everywhere. 
And so instead of these $250,000 versions we're going to make these $3,000 versions and schools 
can have them, you know students can have them, and you set it next to your PC or Mac and all of 
a sudden you have your own AI supercomputer. And you could develop and build AIs. Build your own 
AI, build your own R2-D2. What do you feel like is important for this audience to know that I haven't 
asked? One of the most important things I would advise is for example if I were a student today 
the first thing I would do is to learn AI. How do I learn to interact with ChatGPT, how do I learn 
to interact with Gemini Pro, and how do I learn to interact with Grok? Learning how to
interact with with AI is not unlike being someone who is really good at asking questions. 
You're incredibly good at asking questions and and prompting AI is very very similar.
You can't just randomly ask a bunch of questions and so asking an AI to be assistant 
to you requires some expertise and artistry and how to prompt it. And so if I were, 
if I were a student
-> summary ->
*   Artificial intelligence will fundamentally alter human capabilities by automating routine tasks, enabling individuals to dedicate their cognitive resources to uniquely valuable endeavors.
*   The accessibility of AI technology is projected to dramatically increase, transitioning from specialized, high-cost research systems to widely available, affordable consumer-grade devices.
*   The proliferation of AI is anticipated across diverse professional and educational sectors, representing a shift towards ubiquitous integration within computing infrastructure.
*   Effective interaction with advanced AI models necessitates a focus on developing sophisticated prompting skills, mirroring the expertise required for skilled questioning and requiring artistic aptitude for optimal outcomes.
