hello my name is hafa paulo i'm originally from brazil and i'm gonna try in this next three short minutes describe what i had been immersed working for these last two weeks uh basically i've created an architecture that provides brazilians with bank accounts to acquire any token or cryptocurrency from uob in a more private way and by providing this bridge we have a market maker fee included that every night is converted half into this crypto derivative of a carbon credit mos and the other half is sent directly to in packet market mechanisms of poverty alleviation uh i call a tripler system what i have developed uh which is basically dao that is gonna share and manage this um carbon credit vote that's always increasing with the usage of uh the bridge uh the dap which provides in a decentralized way all the who would be market data that's coming on chain and the most important which was the agent the agent works connected with cellul local node reading the cell blockchain transfers and so on and the internet interplanetary file system which is the backbone of the web tree [Music] going fast the agency keeps reading the market data from huawei converts it to sell hell and publishes it using this new interplanetary name system path a url that's that doesn't change you and it's kind of new since the every time you change a file on ipfs it changed the the the data we solved it in an interesting way having this contract called the hybrid x which is basically uh having own chain orders and executing it off chain creating a sort of a layer of uh privacy for the people who are acquiring uh tokens and cryptocurrencies i know that time is not going to be too much to describe all of this i invite you to read the docs it's very well described and i'm very excited with the vision that i wrote there since i guess we're not just like a computer science we're we're involved in a lot of a history of technology and this is we are seeing earlier times for much more to come in these next
-> summary ->
*   A new architectural framework has been developed to enable Brazilian citizens to acquire tokens and cryptocurrencies through UOB, prioritizing enhanced privacy.
*   The system incorporates a “tripler” mechanism utilizing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to manage and expand a carbon credit voting pool, linked to both carbon credit derivatives and poverty alleviation market mechanisms.
*   The core of the system involves an agent connected to the Cell blockchain, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), and a hybrid x contract, facilitating decentralized market data aggregation and off-chain order execution for increased privacy.
*   The technology leverages IPFS’s persistent URL structure and the Cell blockchain to continuously update market data, ultimately aiming to represent a foundational shift in technological applications concerning socio-environmental impact.
