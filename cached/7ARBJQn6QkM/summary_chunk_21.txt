t future the best version 
of it. And that's the reason why scientists want to predict the future. That's the reason why, 
that's the reason why we try to predict the future and everything that we try to design so that we 
can optimize for the best version. So if someone is watching this and maybe they came into 
this video knowing that NVIDIA is an incredibly important company but not fully understanding why 
or how it might affect their life and they're now hopefully better understanding a big shift that 
we've gone through over the last few decades in computing, this very exciting, very sort of strange 
moment that we're in right now, where we're sort of on the precipice of so many different things. 
If they would like to be able to look into the future a little bit, how would you advise them to 
prepare or to think about this moment that they're in personally with respect to how these tools 
are actually going to affect them? Well there are several ways to reason about the future that 
we're creating. One way to reason about it is, suppose the work that you do continues to 
be important but the effort by which you do it went from you know being a week long 
to almost instantaneous. You know that the effort of drudgery basically goes to zero. 
What is the implication of that? This is, this is very similar to what would change if all 
of a sudden we had highways in this country? And that kind of happened you know in the last 
Industrial Revolution, all of a sudden we have interstate highways and when you have interstate 
highways what happens? Well you know suburbs start to be created and and all of a sudden you know 
distribution of goods from east to west is no longer a concern and all of a sudden gas 
stations start cropping up on highways and and fast food restaurants show up and you 
know someone, some motels show up because people you know traveling across the state, across the 
country and just wanted to stay somewhere for a few hours or overnight, and so a
-> summary ->
*   Scientists pursue future prediction to optimize design and understand a significant shift in computing over the past decades.
*   Individuals should consider how the reduction of effort in their work – exemplified by transitioning from lengthy tasks to instantaneous ones – will fundamentally alter their professional landscape.
*   The analogy of interstate highways illustrates the transformative impact of readily accessible infrastructure, leading to spatial shifts in economic activity and the emergence of new industries and services.
*   Preparing for this future requires acknowledging the profound changes in productivity and distribution, recognizing the potential for unprecedented access to resources and opportunities.
