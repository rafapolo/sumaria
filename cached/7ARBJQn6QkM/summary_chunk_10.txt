to sound. You can learn even languages and vocabulary and syntax and 
grammar and all just by studying a whole bunch of letters and words. So we've now demonstrated 
that AI or deep learning has the ability to learn almost any modality of data and it can translate 
to any modality of data. And so what does that mean? You can go from text to text, right, summarize a 
paragraph. You can go from text to text, translate from language to language. You can go from text 
to images, that's image generation. You can go from images to text, that's captioning. You can even go 
from amino acid sequences to protein structures. In the future, you'll go from protein to words: "What 
does this protein do?" or "Give me an example of a protein that has these properties." You know 
identifying a drug target. And so you could just see that all of these problems are around 
the corner to be solved. You can go from words to video, why can't you go from words to action 
tokens for a robot? You know from the computer's perspective how is it any different? And so it 
it opened up this universe of opportunities and universe of problems that we can go solve. And 
that gets us quite excited. It feels like we are on the cusp of this truly enormous change. 
When I think about the next 10 years, unlike the last 10 years, I know we've gone through a lot of 
change already but I don't think I can predict anymore how I will be using the technology that is 
currently being developed. That's exactly right. I think the last 10, the reason why you feel that way 
is, the last 10 years was really about the science of AI. The next 10 years we're going to have plenty 
of science of AI but the next 10 years is going to be the application science of AI. The fundamental 
science versus the application science. And so the the applied research, the application side of AI 
now becomes: How can I apply AI to digital biology? How can I apply AI to climate technology? How can 
I apply AI to agriculture, to fishery, 
-> summary ->
*   Deep learning models have demonstrated the capacity to learn and translate across diverse data modalities, including text, images, and amino acid sequences.
*   This capability enables applications such as text summarization, language translation, image generation, and captioning, alongside the potential for generating protein structures and robot action tokens.
*   The future of AI development will shift from foundational scientific research to applied research, focusing on practical applications in fields like digital biology, climate technology, and agriculture.
*   Significant technological advancements are anticipated within the next decade, with predictions indicating a transformative impact across numerous sectors due to the expanding capabilities of AI.
