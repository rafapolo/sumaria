At some point, you have to believe something. 
We've reinvented computing as we know it. What is the vision for what you see coming next? We 
asked ourselves, if it can do this, how far can it go? How do we get from the robots that 
we have now to the future world that you see? Cleo, everything that moves will be 
robotic someday and it will be soon. We invested tens of billions of dollars before 
it really happened. No that's very good, you did some research! But the big breakthrough 
I would say is when we... That's Jensen Huang, and whether you know it or not
his decisions are shaping your future. He's the CEO of NVIDIA, the company that skyrocketed over the past few
years to become one of the most valuable companies in the world because they led a fundamental shift 
in how computers work unleashing this current explosion of what's possible with technology. 
"NVIDIA's done it again!" We found ourselves being one of the most important technology companies in 
the world and potentially ever. A huge amount of the most futuristic tech that you're hearing about 
in AI and robotics and gaming and self-driving cars and breakthrough medical research relies on 
new chips and software designed by him and his company. During the dozens of background interviews 
that I did to prepare for this what struck me most was how much Jensen Huang has already influenced 
all of our lives over the last 30 years, and how many said it's just the beginning of something 
even bigger. We all need to know what he's building and why and most importantly what he's trying 
to build next. Welcome to Huge Conversations... Thank you so much for doing this. I'm so happy to do 
it. Before we dive in, I wanted to tell you how this interview is going to be a little bit 
different than other interviews I've seen you do recently. Okay! I'm not going to ask you any 
questions about - you could ask - company finances, thank you! I'm not going to ask you questions 
about your management style or why you do
