Fundamentally the reason why I was certain that CUDA was going to be successful 
and we put the whole company behind it was because fundamentally our GPU was going to be 
the highest volume parallel processors built in the world because the market of video games was so 
large and so this architecture has a good chance of reaching many people. It has seemed to me like 
creating CUDA was this incredibly optimistic "huge if true" thing to do where you were saying, if we 
create a way for many more people to use much more computing power, they might create incredible 
things. And then of course it came true. They did. In 2012, a group of three researchers submits an 
entry to a famous competition where the goal is to create computer systems that could recognize 
images and label them with categories. And their entry just crushes the competition. It gets way 
fewer answers wrong. It was incredible. It blows everyone away. It's called AlexNet, and it's a kind 
of AI called the neural network. My understanding is one reason it was so good is that they used 
a huge amount of data to train that system and they did it on NVIDIA GPUs. All of a sudden, 
GPUs weren't just a way to make computers faster and more efficient they're becoming the engines 
of a whole new way of computing. We're moving from instructing computers with step-by-step directions 
to training computers to learn by showing them a huge number of examples. This moment in 2012 really 
kicked off this truly seismic shift that we're all seeing with AI right now. Could you describe 
what that moment was like from your perspective and what did you see it would mean for all of 
our futures? When you create something new like CUDA, if you build it, they might not come. And
that's always the cynic's perspective however the optimist's perspective would say, but 
if you don't build it, they can't come. And that's usually how we look at the world. You know we 
have to reason about intuitively why this would be very useful
-> summary ->
*   The initial confidence in CUDA’s success stemmed from NVIDIA’s projected market leadership in high-volume parallel processors, particularly due to the expansive video game market.
*   A pivotal moment occurred in 2012 when a research team utilized NVIDIA GPUs to develop AlexNet, a neural network system that decisively outperformed all competitors in an image recognition challenge.
*   The use of massive datasets for training AlexNet demonstrated GPUs’ emerging role as the foundational engines for a new paradigm of computing, shifting from step-by-step instruction to data-driven learning.
*   This development, specifically the success of AlexNet, initiated a transformative shift within the computing landscape, fundamentally reshaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence.
