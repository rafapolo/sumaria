nced incredibly and that's essential because we want to create you 
know more intelligent systems and and we want to use more computation to be smarter and so 
energy efficiency to do the work is our number one priority. When I was preparing for this interview, I 
spoke to a lot of my engineering friends and this is a question that they really wanted me to ask. So 
you're really speaking to your people here. You've shown a value of increasing accessibility 
and abstraction, with CUDA and allowing more people to use more computing power in all kinds of 
other ways. As applications of technology get more specific, I'm thinking of transformers in AI for 
example... For the audience, a transformer is a very popular more recent structure of AI that's now 
used in a huge number of the tools that you've seen. The reason that they're popular is because 
transformers are structured in a way that helps them pay "attention" to key bits of information and 
give much better results. You could build chips that are perfectly suited for just one kind of AI 
model, but if you do that then you're making them less able to do other things. So as these specific 
structures or architectures of AI get more popular, my understanding is there's a debate between how 
much you place these bets on "burning them into the chip" or designing hardware that is very specific 
to a certain task versus staying more general and so my question is, how do you make those bets? How 
do you think about whether the solution is a car that could go anywhere or it's really optimizing 
a train to go from A to B? You're making bets with huge stakes and I'm curious how you think 
about that. Yeah and that now comes back to exactly your question, what are your 
core beliefs? And the question, the core belief either one, that transformer is the last AI 
algorithm, AI architecture that any researcher will ever discover again, or that transformers 
is a stepping stone towards evolutions of transformers that are uh bar
-> summary ->
*   The primary focus is on energy efficiency within computing systems, recognizing its critical role in developing more sophisticated AI technologies.
*   Increasing accessibility and abstraction through technologies like CUDA are acknowledged as a key strategy for expanding computational power utilization.
*   A central debate exists concerning hardware design, specifically the balance between creating highly specialized chips tailored to particular AI architectures versus developing more general-purpose systems.
*   The core belief regarding the future of AI architecture is being examined, with a consideration of whether transformer models represent a definitive endpoint or merely a transitional phase for subsequent advancements.
